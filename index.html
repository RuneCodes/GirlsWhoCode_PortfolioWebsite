      <div class="About">
      <p> Welcome to Hana's portfolio! Hana is both an artist and a programmer who enjoys exploring the intersection between art and technology. A recent graduate of the [     ] filmmaking foundation, Hana spends her time in the worlds of theater and film - and how to create technology for those industries - at her high school. <br> <br>

        As the Head of Videography at her school's tech theater department, Hana designs and deploys sound and video effects for school plays. Using Qlab, Audacity, and more, she creates engaging soundscapes that draw the audience into the production. Recently, her work in Badger won <i> Best Sound Design</i> from the ESAG. <br> <br>
        
        Hana also serves as the post-production officer for her school's film club. There, she helps manage the production of the club's yearly short film. This year, she also founded her school's first film showcase. Explore her portfolio, where you can see her selected works.<br><br></p>
